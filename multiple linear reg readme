MULTIPLE LINEAR REGRESSION
q1)What Is Multiple Linear Regression?
Multiple Linear Regression is just like Simple Linear Regression, but with more than one input (feature).
Instead of predicting something using one thing, you’re predicting it using many things.
example:
Let’s say you want to predict house price.
In Simple Linear Regression, you'd use only one feature like:
Number of rooms → House price
But in Multiple Linear Regression, you'd use many features, like: Number of rooms,House size,Distance to school,Age of house

q2)what is its eqn?
y = m1 * x1 + m2 * x2 + m3 * x3 + ... + c
x1,x2,x3 are the input features
m1,m2,m3 are the coefficients (weights) for each feature
y is the predicted value (like house price)

q3)how do i visualise it?
You can’t draw a straight line in multiple dimensions…
So instead of a line, think of it as a flat surface (a plane) in higher dimensions.
2 features → prediction is a plane in 3D
3+ features → you can’t visualize easily, but it’s a hyperplane

q4)what is the exact formula used in linear agreba?
theta = (Xᵀ X)⁻¹ Xᵀ y
Where:
X is the feature matrix (rows = samples, columns = features)
y is the target/output vector
theta is the parameter vector (includes slopes and intercept)
Xᵀ is the transpose of X
(Xᵀ X)⁻¹ is the inverse of the matrix Xᵀ X
